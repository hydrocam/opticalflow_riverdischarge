# Camera Based River Surface Velocity and Discharge Estimation using Deep Optical Flow

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation used for estimating river surface velocity and discharge from video imagery using deep optical flow models. Surface velocities are extracted from video frames and combined with surveyed bathymetry and water stage measurements to compute river discharge.

The workflow follows the methodology presented in the associated Journal of Hydrology manuscript.
