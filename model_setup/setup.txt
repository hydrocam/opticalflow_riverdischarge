These setup scripts prepare the environment and install all required dependencies for each optical flow model.

Run the provided model_setup files before executing the notebooks. Each script installs the libraries and configurations needed to reproduce the experiments.

Alternatively, you may follow the official documentation of FlowFormer++ or MMFlow if you prefer manual installation.

MaskFlowNet and LiteFlowNet2 were implemented through the MMFlow framework and therefore share the same setup procedure.
